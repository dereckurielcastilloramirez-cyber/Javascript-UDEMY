    <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" align="justify"> I was a student of automotive systems engineering with a specialty in systems control at UPIITA at the IPN, my career at the institution allowed me to learn more about the operation of automotive systems in a more technical and focused way, as well as the control of systems and how they can work both in power electronics and in control in cars, in the same way I modeled parts in solidworks to achieve general assemblies of automotive parts. I was able to train a neural network using libraries compatible with Python 3.11, such as TensorFlow version 2.18 and PyTorch version 11.8, and evaluate its performance during training. Additionally, I optimized PyTorch with CUDA version 9.0 and cuDNN version 8.6 using the GPU, leveraging an NVIDIA GTX 1050 GPU on a laptop to perform the network's operations in parallel.</p>

    <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" align="justify"> I have carried out internships and projects that allowed me to know the programming environment in C language in an ATMEGA 328P microcontroller and STM32F446RET6, know and manage in a general way in Verilog an FPGA of type NEXYS A7 100T; as well as the management and communication of Python with microcontrollers through serial communication.</p>

    <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" align="justify"> In the same way I learned to modify and adapt convolutional neural networks in this case for my degree integrative project, which involves image processing for the control of light beam illumination in the headlights of a vehicle</p>
    <br>
    <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" align="justify"> I passionate about generete codes to solve problems and optimize, in the same way I enjoy to design and model some parts in Solidworks </p>

    <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" align="justify"> My favorite hobby is take photos, travel to know different and new places, I love learning new languages ​to communicate my ideas more easily. Also, in my free time I love to play Basketball, listen music, read a book and keep me updated with new things or knowledge, not only about my area.</p>
